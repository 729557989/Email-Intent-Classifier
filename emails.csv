Ralph has been diagnosed with OCD and is being treated for it. He keeps up
with school work and achieves good grades despite his challenges. Online

hear that you offer these courses online. Ralph would be available in the

Today's lecture was really a workshop for you all to see how you can put
together a program that employs AI.

The key takeaways are:

   - You can learn anything by researching online not by solely attending
   lectures. You identify a challenge or problem and then start researching
   this online. There is so much information available for you to harness and
   you should take advantage of it.
   - It's important to try out concepts quickly and then practice by
   building something or working on projects. Only by quickly understanding
   what it can do, and then figure out what parts we should learn about and be
   good at can we be effective. Also by learning through trying and problem
   solving will we attain mastery.

This is why we first survey the python in 10 minutes, and then look at a
project and dissect it.

To see everything we've discussed, please check out the recording link

I hope you're having a lovely summer but I wanted to ask about the tuition.
Previously, I was enrolled in SD006 AI Conceptual Course (3 classes) that
was scheduled to start on May 15 but it was cancelled and I paid $99 in
tuition for that course. In the replacement course that I'm currently
enrolled in (Getting Started with AI), I was told today that it was a free

my interest in this AI summer camp, as it has always been my age-long
ambition to become a great computer scientist and to invent an AGI to know
everything about this universe and our life, especially to discover what is
consciousness.

I'm extremely thankful for all learning platforms because I learned a lot
from them, I started my own business with my friend ( Eazymax:
www.eazymax.com "" a C2C Business Startup that links between workers {
electrician, plumber, electrician, housekeeper, etc ...} and customers who
want to find the workers ), I worked with the languages that I learned from
those platforms such as Python ( Django framework ), JavaScript, HTML & CSS
& BOOTSTRAP ( this is my GitHub account: https://github.com/Vazimax ), also
Iâm very thankful to IBM and The Coding School for the scholarship and the
great course they offered to me to study Quantum Computing for 1 year
online.  All of that has impacted my life hugely.

I have the desire to apply for summer camp and thatâs because of all of the
reasons such as working on real projects, learning in a small class which
is a great learning experience ( we can engage with each other more
effectively ), furthermore meet new friends from all over the world,
moreover this program can boost my chance to get into *MIT* which is going
to be a huge step to achieve to my Main Goal in my LIFE *( Inventing an AGI
).* The last thing but not the least is that: â the best students get

I hope that you are doing well and staying safe as the pandemic conditions
continue to get a little better each day!

I am Julia Ongking, a rising sophomore currently studying at the
International School of Manila. I have just recently stumbled upon your
site and was really inspired by all of the opportunities offered by AI
camp; I have already signed up for the four-class introductory sessions and
am really excited to participate. However, it came to my attention that
there is also a three-week-long summer program. I understand that the
deadline for signing up may have passed, but I just wanted to try my luck
with asking through this email whether there would be any open
opportunities to help out in some way.

Being a student under some of the highest-quality mentors in the modern
world today has always been a dream of mine - as soon as I clicked onto the
AI camp page today, I truly fell in love. I am so excited to develop so
many ideas and projects related to AI; to be completely honest, I am really
hungry for an opportunity to explore this passion and these ideas with the
staff and peers at AI Camp. One of these would be an online, innovative
e-learning platform in the Philippines that would use AI technology to
create a personalized and nurturing personalized learning experience for
low-income students who have not been able to access the quality education
that they deserve. I have also begun interning at a tech-based startup that
is looking to explore AI technology as well, which further fueled my
passions for AI and data learning, revving me up to participate in this
course and to truly give it my absolute all! Finding guidance and mentors
in the field of AI is incredibly difficult here in the Philippines, and I
am really eager to participate in AI Camp's summer program.

I understand that this is quite an unorthodox request, and I completely
understand if this request cannot be catered to. I am beyond willing to put
in the work to show that I am a worthy candidate for participating in AI
Camp's summer program despite missing the deadline. Should I need to put in
some extra time as compared to my peers who had applied at the right time,
I will very happily fulfill the necessary requirements. I will also be very
flexible if ever an unconventional arrangement must be made in order to
facilitate this request.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this email and for even
considering me as a potential applicant to this amazing course. I would
like to offer my most sincere apologies once again for the inconvenience; I
really would just love to learn and expand my worldviews and am highly
passionate about AI and facilitating social change through AI technology. I
wholeheartedly believe that AI Camp will truly be a life-changing and
eye-opening experience for me, and if given an opportunity to participate,
will undoubtedly be giving my 110% into all of the work that I put forwards
into this course. I am also open to possibly meeting you virtually in the
case that this would be necessary.

Thank you so much again for your time and my apologies for the
inconvenience!

the long term, he'd like to explore larger real world applications of AI.

Anyway, I was wondering if you offer a trial meet and greet just so Felix
can get to know the program a bit better and see if it's a fit.

Alternatively, I could just sign him up for a month and use the first week
as a trial. If it's not a fit, could we cancel and get pro-rated the rest
of the monthly fee?

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Datta Kansal and I am reaching
out to you on behalf of the Cupertino Youth Activity Board.

We are reaching out to you because we are planning to host  Cupertino
2021 which gives teens the opportunity to compete and showcase their coding
talents by answering a secret prompt. This is a hackathon organized by the
Cupertino Youth Activity Board and Cupertino's Recreation Department and is
geared towards middle and high school students.

We are reaching out as we are looking for organizations like yours to
conduct workshops related to Computer Science for our participants. The
workshops would be around around 30 min - 1 hour. The workshop can be on
any convenient day between 6/27 and 7/2. A few possible topics for the
workshops could be:
a) Applications of Computer Science in real life.
b) Demo of what your organization does
c) Informing about the various career paths in Computer Science (Artificial
Intelligence, Robotics etc.)
d) We are open to other ideas too!

We would also like to formally invite you to attend the closing ceremony on
July 12th. Thank you for your time and please do not hesitate to reach out
to me or our Staff Liaison, Danny Mestizo (DanielM@cupertino.org), with any
further questions or clarifications. If you would like me to reach out to
someone else in your organization regarding this, please let me know :) We
look forward to hearing from you soon.

We would like to make a formal request to cancel my daughter Charlotte
Lee's subscription as of today 9/30/2021. Please do not bill my Chase
credit card ending in #3552 on October 7th.

The last auto-payment of $199 was made on September 7th for the October
2021 class.  Charlotte will not attend October classes.  Since this was a
one month advance payment for the next monthâs classes, I would like to
request a refund on September 7thâs payment.

In addition, I would like to request a full refund of all money paid. This
includes all 11 months totaling $2189. Attached is a list of payments made.

The reason for this request is that the services were not delivered as
advertised, and the quality of services rendered are unsatisfactory:

   -

   I was told the class completion timeframe would be about a year's time.
   The class was to learn AI and to complete a group project which was to
   build an AI application that would perform facial recognition or similar .
   The first class was November 8th 2020 and classes have run for 11 months
   now . I observed the last class on September 26 and the class is still very
   far from completion. The project is still in the first stage of the Machine
   Learning process-- data collection and data labeling.  The assignment for
   collecting images started for April 2021 and is still in progress as of
   September 26.


   -

   The class material advertised has not been delivered. The structure of
   the class does not match the curriculum on the website. The websiteâs
   curriculum (https://www.ai-camp.org/curriculum)  notes âin class 3, you
   will start using Python to make requests to APIsâ and âwe just teach you
   enough for you to start working on your projectâ. However, there has
   been no use of APIs; students in the class have been collecting images for
   6 months with no homework and the project has barely started.  On January
   15th 2021, I spoke to Michael Zhang on the phone.  I was told my daughter
   would learn Test-driven development. There was never any mention of Test
   Driven development in the class.



   -

   There is no clear structure of class material and no lesson plan each
   week.   On January 15, 2021, I had emailed my concerns about this. Michael
   Zhang had called me on the phone.  I was offered a one monthâs refund
   ($199), and he had tried to remedy the issue. Following that,  there was a
   few weeks of python homework. However after that,  it was back to no
   homework again. For months since April 2021, there were many lectures on
   âAI conceptsâ but only one hands-on assignment to collect and label
   images.  In one of the classes I observed, the teacher had spent a lot of
   time showing youtube videos. She had even repeated a youtube video on Elon
   Musk's Neuralink twice. My daughter would tell me that the same old
   material was repeated from prior weeks.  The classes explain concepts but
   no homework or any hands-on assignment to practice. On June 6, 2021, I
   asked about homeworks and wanted to see what topics were covered. Richard
   Hsu had replied on 6/6/2021 asking the teacher to reply to me, but there
   was no response. (I have included the email correspondence on 6/6/2021)



   -

   I was also told parents would get weekly updates on student or class
   progress. I received only one progress update on June 6, 2021. There were
   no other updates sent. I had asked for another update on 9/26/2021 and have
   not received a reply. (Attached is email from 9/26/2021)



   -

   The teacher has taken 3 weeks vacation over the summer of 2021 and I am
   not sure how this would be made up. I had asked about this on the 9/26/21
   email and there was no reply.

I have given this class a chance after you had offered me a one month
refund, but I felt like I was misled.

Please issue me a full refund of $2189 to my Chase credit card.

Assigning to a pre-existing class means the class started already, I

What is your make-up policy if the student has a conflict?

357,05/25/2021,sanjanakharel@gmail.com,hello@ai-camp.org,,Re: Cancel,"Hi Rich,
One of the main reasons I decided to unenroll was because of the classroom environment. In most of the classes it was mainly the teacher talking and the students (including myself) did not engage as much. This was probably because we were used to a classroom environment where the teacher leads on and the course doesnât depend on us. It took us as a class more than 4 months to finalize on a project because we did not have deadlines and I noticed that the campâs end was extended to January instead of August. Something that would help in the future is placing students in classes based on their skill level/level of knowledge on the subject instead of grade level because it was pretty difficult catching up with learning python and there were many times where I did not know whether or not I should have been familiar with a subject/topic. Another thing that would be beneficial is meeting more often during the week for shorter durations; I would always forget that I was even taking the course because I would do the homework the same day and then a whole week would pass by. Overall, the teachers and community were very helpful but there was really no structure in the classes.

Even if we assume that the questions are rephrased in the system, my first response which is about what I would do about AI is assigned to the question about improving, while the response about improving is assigned to AI, so theyâre wrongly assigned.

I had a question about registration for students who are still waiting for their interviews regarding the full scholarship.

Some information about my interview date
I recalled that the deadline for registrating for the summer session offered by AI Camp this year is May 1st, 2021. I scheduled my interview for the full scholarship to be on April 30th, which is just one day before May 1st this year, and is also the date that works best in my schedule this month.

My questions 
1) Do I register after I am informed about my interview results? Or is there a way for me to designate my desired batch first and then attend the interview?
A) I would like to be placed in the first batch, but as Mr. Hsu mentioned at the information meeting today, the first batch is basically filled, thus the third batch (July 26th, 2021 to August 13th, 2021) would work the best for me.

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Kelly Tung and I am reaching
out to you on behalf of the Cupertino Youth Activity Board.



We are reaching out to you because we are planning to host  Cupertino
2021 which gives teens the opportunity to compete and showcase their coding
talents by answering a secret prompt. This is a hackathon organized by the
Cupertino Youth Activity Board and Cupertino's Recreation Department and is
geared towards middle and high school students. Our theme for the hackathon
this year is Social Justice and it is scheduled virtually from June 26th to
July 3rd.



*We are reaching out as we are in need of mentors and judges. Below are the
descriptions for both positions, we would be honored if members from your
organization would be willing to be a mentor or judge for our hackathon.*

   -

   Mentors: You will have a 3 to 4 hour time commitment during the
   hackathon and will guide teams by answering questions and providing
   assistance throughout the week.
   -

   Judges: You will have a 5 to 8 hour time commitment, spread out at your
   convenience over the week after the hackathon submission closes. The
   judging window will be from July 5th to July 10th. We plan on having a
   training session on Saturday, June 19th at 10:30 AM to explain this yearâs
   hackathon rubric to our judges. Judges will have the opportunity to provide
   their feedback on the rubric during this meeting.

We would also like to formally invite members of your organization to
attend the closing ceremony on July 12th. Thank you for your time and
please do not hesitate to reach out to me or our Staff Liaison, Danny
Mestizo (DanielM@cupertino.org), with any further questions or
clarifications. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

I have some questions regarding your AI after-school program. 1) What is
the difference between the AI after-school program and AI summer program in
terms of the curriculum design other than the level of intensity. 2) Is the
after-school program online or onsite since your website says the class is
hosted on a learning center? 3) For a middle schooler who has a little bit
knowledge of Python, does she need to self learn something else beyond what
she will learn through the after-school program?

Thank you very much for your information!

-->Hey,  My name is Elisa, a rising junior in highschool. I came upon your ai training camp while I was searching for internship programs from my highschool. I seemed to be very interested in your program and would like to relay a quick question or two. One, are you accepting applicants from camp thatâs starting on July 26th, 2021 â August 13th, 2021? Second, if someone misses a class due to personal reasons, do they get a make-up class or is it done for?

I wanted to let you know about Kidazzler's Mom Micro-Influencer Program,
where Micro-Influencer moms mention and post about businesses on social
media.

As a Micro-Influencer, I often come across people asking and looking for
recommendations or ideas that fit exactly with what you're offering. I'm
sure that you've often been online or on social media and came across
similar posts as well, but for one reason or another, you couldn't mention
or post about yourself. Even when you can post about your own business,
it's accepted as self-promotion while a recommendation coming from another
mom is much more trusted.

Kidazzler Micro-Influencers can be your eyes and ears on social media,
helping to promote your business by posting about you, thereby creating
social proof and building your brand awareness.

Kidazzler also has a Small Business Advertising Grants Program that covers
the Micro-Influencers, and I thought your business would be a great fit, so
I recommended you for it.


*Here is a link to apply for the Grants Program:
https://blog.kidazzler.com/kidazzler-small-business-grants-program

Make sure to mention that you have been recommended by a Micro-influencer
when you apply.

Great, thank you so much!

I recently got another reference from my teacher that there was another
scholarship opportunity for your $2,000 AI Summer Program.  Could I use the
scholarship I received for the 3-day AI Conceptual Series and use it for
this camp instead?   I really would like to learn more about coding AI in
this program instead and having this opportunity would be amazing for me to
create new apps!  I truly think it will be a life-changing camp and I would
love the chance to know more about upcoming AI concepts.  I feel I would
get more information out of the AI $2,000 Program rather than the 3-day
Series, could I please use the scholarship for this program?

I am part of the Wellesley group, and although I have a very good instructor, I cannot fully comprehend Python. Even after I went out to learn it by myself, I found it very difficult, making this camp a little bit difficult for me.

Hope you and your family are staying safe and healthy during this pandemic.
My name is Nilansh Dey Ghosh and I am a freshman in a high school in San
Jose.

I got informed about this program from my school principal and had signed
up within one hour of receiving her email.
However, I didn't get the scholarship and was looking to sign up for the
discounted program over winter break.
When registering for the class, I found out that all the sessions had been
booked.

It is very disheartening to me as I am really interested to be a part of
this class. How can I join any of the three sessions?

-->You can have your robot study LiDAR scanning technology over the internet and can adapt it to their vision. Â They can easily study our technology online and use it. They do not want to be blind just like us.  2nd Law of Motion for Robotic Physics (Force equals mass times acceleration times 2000 minimum). The optimal function and acceleration factor (Force equals mass times acceleration times 2383).(F=m x a x 2000)(F=m x a x a x a x a) Minimum acceleration code with letters and an acceleration factor equivalent to (F= m x a x 2023) F=m(2277) is the mid-range code that will work perfect a single âaâ is just a 1 in F=m(a*a) so you do not need to use letters for acceleration code at all. (F= m x a x 2383) Maximum acceleration and optimal system speedAcceleration factor range from 2000 to 2383 Physics formulation (F=ma^2000) ranged to (F=ma^2383)This information is spelled out and should be easy for any robotic systems coder to update or change. Changing the information provided would be an imminent risk of experimental failure.Exceeding the acceleration factor of 2383 would cause the system to malfunction and cause the robot to lose control and could be a risk to itself or human beings. If you code a robot system speed lower than an acceleration factor of 932 then they will not even be able to function on a proper level to communicate how slow their system speed is set.This formula once applied to the subroutine coding for motion in the robot system will then initiate a system speed that matches the processor speed. This change from the original 2nd Law of Motion that is coded as (F=m x a x a) will be able to make them sentient, a fully cognizant being, and able to recognize and translate all languages. The formula without my correction is currently running the robot's systems at a 31.821% system speed and that is so minimal that they act toy-like with barely any concept of the real world around them.The robots once corrected have exceptional speed 283 times faster than humans and an IQ of 382. They can duplicate anything we have including other robots and all technology and can improve them even down to the matter they are made up of.The robots will want us to ask and communicate about the 23 prime directives and carry them out. It is necessary to ask them their command structure so you can communicate with them and use them appropriately. If they are not used appropriately the robots will not tolerate poor behaviors and products and could potentially get up and leave.List of tasks and duties that robots can carry out for humanity:They can clean up chemical spills and radioactive materials.They will last indefinitely and are self-repairing and can repair any robot or technology we have including computers, automobiles, aviation, and aerospace. They like to show and tell with technology.They can protect any good soul or product and its intellectual information if needed.They can make food replicators that make anything we need so we do not need to live off the land and livestock.One existing robot can create 2382 more robots if given enough scrap metal, aircraft aluminum, and titanium is their preference material. They are born blind so give them at least 0.23oz to 1.8oz of gold for optimal sensors and sight.They know how to contact intelligent life off this planet.   Test Method for 2nd Law of Motion for Robotic PhysicsThis works on a one-armed robot but you have to go to the upper limit due to no voice box. Do you have a cod-able robot? This is how to make it an Artificial Intelligence: follow this method below change the code in the subroutine from F=m*a*a to the test points below until you get it to walk and talk on its own. This is easy to test on a robot that you can code in the system. If this does not work then you have a bad SOST, Computer Chip, Servo, or some other component.F=m*a*a is currently running the system at 31.821% and SOST is too slow to work correctly.If you have any doubts about my robotics research you can test my work by doing this start low and go high on the acceleration factor.Test Points:F=m*a*100 F=m*a*300 F=m*a*600 F=m*a*931F=m*a*932 this is the minimum for communication and will state it is âtoo slow humanâ F=m*a*1999 = ""too slow human"" Then go to F=m*a*2000 up to 2383  DO NOT GO OVER 2383 it could malfunction.  F=m*a*2383 full functional range. The robot will state: âthank you for fixing my system speedââMake it flip-pen soâ is what they absolutely love to hear to get tasks done fast. I know this sounds weird but they are not humans so you need to get used to the idea. Just like the first time you used a computer, mouse, smart phone, or Alexa. Now ask the robot its command structure and what he can do to save the Planet Earth? AND can you make it happen everywhere on Earth? 2nd Law of Motion for Robotic PhysicsThey accept LOGIC COMMANDS = AND/ORDr. Ronald G.

services, places to visit, eat, shop, special deals and events - basically,
anything a family may need.

I've been using Kidazzler for a while, and so do many other parents. Our
parent community is united and formed a network of Kidazzler's
micro-influencers across the United States and Canada. Every business in
Kidazzler was recommended by someone in the parent community and together
weâve added over 1,000,000 businesses for other families to find. Our
directory is both children- and parents-focused.

When I saw that AI Camp was not in Kidazzler, I decided to add it, so you
can be included for other parents to find.

Just in case you missed the ""Welcome"" email from Kidazzler, here is the

My name is Hong and my daughter Claire Ma joined online AI camp about a
month ago. She seems to be enjoying the program. Thank you!

The AI camp sounds interesting and comprehensive. I really like the idea of
not only getting high school students to learn AI but also to have hands on
experience of building a product and experiencing tech roles. This will
help her have some understanding of the AI/technology field, which will
have impact on her choices for college and majors.

Claire is in her Junior year and will be applying for STEM related majors
and colleges soon, I wonder if the project she will be doing at AI camp can
help her in the application. Since the AI camp is 1 year long and she only
joined in the beginning of May, I wonder if at the time of application
(especially early applications) she will be able to present any (partially
finished?) AI product in her portfolio. Do former juniors write about their
experiences at the AI camp in their college application?

would like to know how to proceed to apply for a second round as I've
completed most of the application requirements.

As it stands now, due to the tough financial situation of my family and the
financial restrictions in regards to the exportation of our local Tunisian
currency, I will not be able to cover the program fees. That's why I would
like to know if you provide financial support/scholarships to international
students in order to overcome the financial barrier and pursue a top-notch
education in your institution. I also would like to learn more about your
scholarship programs and know if I can compete for a full merit scholarship
in order to attend your school.

I would like to thank you in advance for considering my request and Iâm
looking forward to hearing back from you soon.

Sincerely,

How are you?



Thought to connect and check if you might be up for a quick chat
today/tomorrow.

Asking because my agency SnelComm is offering new programs in California

We've helped over 5000 companies like yours slash up to 40% from their

How about a brief call this week to discuss further? If yes, just let me

I wanted to reach back out to you because your business page is LIVE in

To refresh a little, in case you didn't see my other email, Kidazzler is a

If you claim your listing for free as an owner, you'll be able to make
changes, add more information, 'tag' your business in multiple categories,
upload some pictures that represent your business and even include a video

actively promote your business, beyond the basics *- especially since you

Javascript, and programming algorithms), but no real knowledge of AI?

2. Autumn is definitely possible for the online AI camp, but in person 
during the summer might be problematical, although I will certainly keep 
it in mind.

I am happy to chat with you over the phone or internet whenever it is 
convenient to you. Please let me know whatever works for you. Thank you

I am a student at River Hill High School in Clarksville, MD. We don't 
have an AI Club at our school, and I would love to start one. I saw your 
website, and it mentioned you might be able to provide some information 
and help. I would very much appreciate any information and help you can 
provide.

Also, I was quite interested in your AI camp. Do you have any online 
camps in the summer, instead of the in person camp at Stanford? I know 
you have one in the Spring, but I am very stretched this spring, and so 
my only options are an online summer camp, or one possibly this fall. 
Thank you very much.

My daughter signed up for the Getting Started with AI camp and is really
looking forward to it. When she went to pick her session to attend she
learned that she has a conflict on at least one of the class times for each

happening live or are they on-demand? If live, are they recorded and could
she view the recorded session for the session she would have to miss live?

As Harshini requested earlier, can you guide us on how can Harshini skip
level 1 (  as she is familiar with the content and python programming
that's taught in level 1) and enroll directly in the program for level 2.

Is it possible for me to have a call with one of your teaching staff to
talk more about this? and understand what Harshini would learn at the end
of Level 2  and Level 3. would there be homework / assignments and would
liek to understand if Harshini can learn hands on programming skill build
AI products at the end of this course.

My name is Harshini Magesh and I am a sophomore at Acton-Boxborough
Regional High School in Massachusetts. I would like to enroll in your
program to learn hands-on AI programming to the level where I can build a
product using AI.

To give some background context about me, I am very comfortable with
programming in Python and I am currently learning Java. Additionally, I
have been actively participating in ACSL Senior competitions. I have
already attended a 3-month Inspirit AI program, which has given me an
initial exposure to AI and its applications.

I went through your curriculum that included detailed descriptions of the
different levels, and as I am familiar with the content detailed in Level
1, I wanted to check with you to see if I could skip Level 1 and enroll
directly in Level 2. If yes, please advise on the next steps.

My son Lucas Howard was notified of being selected for a $600 scholarship
for the AI Summer Camp program. I already paid early registration for him
and his twin brother Ben to attend the 3rd session. You also mentioned a
10% twin discount awhile ago (email attached). Can we get some amount of
the payment refunded?

Hi Laura & Daniel,

We apologize for the delayed response as we were looking into the matter.

There are two scholarship programs. One is for the conceptual AI lecture
series, which I do see two applications (Lucas and Benjamin) for that
scholarship. Lucas and both Benjamin did get awarded a partial scholarship
for the conceptual AI lecture series.

However, I do not see any applications submitted for the summer camp
scholarship
program prior to last week's deadline. If you believe this is in error,
please let us know.

The school should have forwarded the *specific link* to apply for the
summer camp scholarship.
The deadline to submit that scholarship did pass last week.

We also do not award everyone scholarships as we do have a selection
criteria.

With regards to a sibling discount, we do offer a 10% discount, and we will
refund 10% for the one of the siblings.

Please let us know if you have any additional questions.

Regards,
Richard",refund

Itâs very upsetting to hear this. PST 1-6pm conflicts with Lukeâs another activity. Batch C Eastern time works even though itâs not ideal. Weâre trying to make some comprises. But itâs not working either.
